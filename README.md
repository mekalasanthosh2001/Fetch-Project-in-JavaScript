***Project Description: Dynamic Product Listing with Fetch API***

This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic product listing webpage using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The Fetch API is utilized to asynchronously retrieve product data from a RESTful API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and display it in a visually appealing format.

**Technologies Used:**

HTML: Provides the structure and content of the webpage.
CSS: Styles the HTML elements to enhance visual presentation.
JavaScript: Implements dynamic behavior and interacts with the Fetch API.
Fetch API: Enables asynchronous data fetching from an external data source.

**Key Features:**

Product Listing Table: Products are displayed in a table format (<table>) with columns for product title, description, price, and image.
Load More Button: A "Load More" button allows users to fetch and display additional products interactively without reloading the page.
Dynamic Data Fetching: Utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve product data asynchronously from the Fake Store API and dynamically updates the webpage content.

**Project Implementation Details:**

HTML Structure: Defines the layout of the webpage including headings, table structure, and buttons.
CSS Styling: Enhances the visual appearance of HTML elements with custom styles for colors, spacing, and responsiveness.

**JavaScript Functions:**
Fetch Products: Uses the Fetch API to retrieve product data from the API endpoint (https://fakestoreapi.com/products).
Display Products: Renders the fetched product data dynamically within the table format.
Load More Functionality: Implements the logic to load additional products upon clicking the "Load More" button.

**Project Summary:**
This project results in a user-friendly product listing webpage where users can view product details in a structured table layout and seamlessly load more products on demand. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Fetch API showcases a modern approach to building interactive and data-driven web applications.
